# Infrastructure

## PaaS

* Simplifies hosting, removes complexity of building/configuring infrastructure
* easier to get started
* eg: Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk
* con: increased costs at scale, less control

## IaaS

* rent data center capabilities
* client responsible for managing all aspects of server (instances, dbs, storage)
* eg: AWS, Google Compute Engine, Digital Ocean
* can fine tune backend to the businesses needs
* con: more technical to manage (issues, patching)

## client side rendering

* browser compiles content from JS
* content burden given to client

## server side rendering

* motivation: limited connection/capacity mobile
* better SEO
* con: performance penalty with all page traffic

> Next.js: initial server sided rendering with following dynamic routing/content rendered by client
